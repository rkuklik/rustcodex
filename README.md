Smuggle code from disallowed languages into [ReCodEx](https://github.com/recodex)

## WHY?

Because I refuse to learn `python` the intended way. Why solve an exercise
in an hour, when you can spend couple of them designing and testing a hack
to smuggle precompiled code (from a normal language) into ReCodEx?

## Disclaimer

While really cool, are you sure this is the intended way to solve ReCodEx exercises?
